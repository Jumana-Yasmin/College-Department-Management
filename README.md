- `department` – Department records and contact info  
- `faculty` – Faculty details, linked to departments  
- `student` – Student details and department mapping  
- `attendance` – Student attendance records  
- `complaint` – Complaints and admin replies  
- `leave` – Leave applications and approval status  
- `result` – Student performance data  
- `fee` – Department fee information  
- `scholarship` – Scholarship records  

All tables are linked through **foreign key relationships** ensuring data consistency and integrity.
